## CCC101 IS1A
## HW INSTRUCTIONS

Write a program to read a list of exam scores given as integer percentages in the range 0 to 100. Display the total number of grades and the number of grades in each letter-grade category as follows: 90 to 100 is an A, 80 to 89 is a B, 70 to 79 is a C, 60 to 69 is a D, and 0 to 59 is an F. Use a negative score as a sentinel value to indicate the end of the input. (The negative value is used only to end the loop, so do not use it in the calculations.) For example, if the input is:
98 87 86 85 85 78 73 72 72 72 70 66 63 50 -1

the output would be

Total number of grades = 14

Number of A's = 1

Number of B's = 4

Number of C's = 6

Number of D's = 2

Number of F's = 1
