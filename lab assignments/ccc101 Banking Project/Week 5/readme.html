<H2>Object-Oriented Programming using Java</H2>
<H3>Create a Simple Banking Application</H3>
</CENTER>


<H3>Objective</H3>

<P>
This exercise will introduce you to the banking project which we will
return to in several labs.  This project will (eventually)
consist of a bank with several customers with several account each and a report.
These classes will evolve over the next weeks.
</P>

<P>
In this exercise, you will create very simple version of the <TT>Account</TT>
class.  You will place this source file in the <TT>banking</TT> package/folder.
A test program, <TT>TestBanking</TT>, has been written that creates
a single account.  It initializes the balance of that account and performs
several simple transactions.  Finally, the test program displays the final
balance of the account.

<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>
Start by creating the folder Week5 in your device. Save the <TT>TestBanking.java</TT> file in this folder.

<OL>

  <LI>Inside the Week5 folder, create the <TT>banking</TT> folder.   
<P>
<TT></TT>
  <LI>Create the <TT>Account</TT> class in the file <TT>Account.java</TT>
      under the <TT>banking</TT> directory.  This class must implement the
      model in the above UML diagram.
      <P>
	<OL>
	  <LI>declare one private object attribute: <TT>balance</TT>; this attribute will hold
	      the current (or "running") balance of the bank account
	  <LI>declare a public constructor that takes one parameter (<TT>init_balance</TT>);
	      that populates the <TT>balance</TT> attribute
	  <LI>declare a public method <TT>getBalance</TT> that retrieves the current balance
	  <LI>declare a public method <TT>deposit</TT> that adds the <TT>amount</TT> parameter to the current balance
	  <LI>declare a public method <TT>withdraw</TT> that removes the <TT>amount</TT> parameter
	      from the current balance
	</OL>
      <P>

  <LI>In the main <TT>Week5</TT> folder, compile the <TT>TestBanking.java</TT>
      file.  This has a cascading effect of compiling all of the classes used
      in the program; thus compiling the <TT>Account.java</TT>
      file under the <TT>banking</TT> directory.<BR>
       
      <P>

  <LI>Run the <TT>TestBanking</TT> class.  You shoud see the following output:
<PRE>
Creating an account with a 500.00 balance.
Withdraw 150.00
Deposit 22.50
Withdraw 47.62
The account has a balance of 324.88
</PRE>

</OL>
